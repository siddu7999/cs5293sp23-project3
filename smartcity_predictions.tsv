Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Smart City Vision
Through the Smart City Challenge Grant, 
Oklahoma City shall develop a “Y” shaped 
“smart zone.” It will expand upon the NW 
Corridor Concept Plan (Classen Blvd. 
and Northwest Expressway), and will also 
extend southward from the Downtown along 
South Western Avenue to SW 59th; as 
well as a corridor along 23rd from Classen 
to Martin Luther King and including the 
Oklahoma Health  Center. The “smart zone” 
will integrate advanced technologies with 
advanced mode options, with contemporary 
land-use, transportation, environmental 
and public health policies to increase the 
corridor’s mobility, safety, economic vitality 
and reduce negative climate change 
impacts.  
Oklahoma City’s application suggests what 
a Smart Oklahoma City looks like. It has 
electric buses and in a smart BRT system, 
self-driving streetcars, user-friendly smart 
phone apps, sensor-rich environments and 
more. This will be accomplished with many 
in-house resources, but also in collaboration 
with many private sector and other entities. 
See Vision Narrative 5, in the I7 subsection 
regarding Strategic Business Models and 
Partnering Opportunities. 
A smart zone shall address the existing 
challenges,  such as:
•	Vehicle congestion during a.m. and p.m. 
peaks; 
•	Inadequate mobility options and 
information for older adults and people 
with disabilities;
•	Needed multimodal and sharing 
economy options;
•	Ways to reduce labor costs;
•	An economy ready for and needing more 
technological growth; 
•	Poor and absent pedestrian and bicycle 
corridor crossings;
•	Strategies to integrate technology to 
improve quality of life; 
•	Lack of transit service which is  frequent 
and attractive enough; 
•	Lack of relatively safe pedestrian and 
bicycle access to adjacent land uses, 
facilities, healthcare providers, essential 
services, etc.;
•	Lack of transit oriented development 
(TOD), and  
•	Community’s desire for increased 
healthy lifestyle options and mode 
options.
In January 2015, the U.S. Department 
of Transportation selected Oklahoma 
City as a “Beta Test” city for a proposed 
transportation policy initiative known as the 
Public Health and Transportation Corridor 
Planning Framework. The framework 
established a method of prioritizing public 
health considerations in the transportation 
planning process.  The policy framework, 
as developed in the Northwest Corridor 
Multimodal   Concept Plan, focused on 
increasing mobility and healthcare access 
through multimodal public transportation 
options.  The Smart City Challenge Grant 
will be the catalyst to implement a vast 
variety of smart technologies within and 
adjacent to this corridor.  
The balance of the Vision Narrative further 
defines how Oklahoma City will apply 
various technologies for a successful 
demonstration project both in the “Beta test” 
corridor and Downtown, and in the in two 2
Oklahoma City, OKother legs of the ‘Y”. 
Oklahoma City’s program management 
approach will be a collaborative effort of 
Oklahoma City’s Planning Department, 
Public Works Department, IT Department, 
and the City’s transit agency (EMBARK). 
Other stakeholders are interested in playing 
a part, such as ODOT and the University 
of Oklahoma; specifically OU’s Intelligent 
Transportation Systems Center and see 
Vision Narrative 5, in the I7 subsection for 
more background. Oklahoma City’s 
Characteristics
Oklahoma City’s population characteristics 
are perfectly aligned with USDOT’s 
preferred characteristics.  
•	Oklahoma City’s 2010 population was 
579,999
•	Oklahoma City’s has a population density 
of 956.4 persons per square mile, given 
the fact that OKC is the 5th largest city 
in land area in the United States (lower 
48), this density is not evenly spread 
out over the City’s 606.41 square miles 
(2010 census).  
•	In fact, downtown OKC is experiencing 
significant residential population growth 
with an estimated downtown residential 
population of nearly 7,500 and this does 
not factor in the population increases to 
be realized when the additional 1,352 
under construction or planned residential 
developments are completed over the 
next few years.  Downtown also supports 
an employment population of over 
55,000 as well.  
•	Specific to the proposed Demonstration 
Project, the three connected corridors 
have over 96,000 jobs, 92,000 
residents, three hospitals, the University 
of Oklahoma Health Science Center, and 
two universities. 
•	Oklahoma City represents 46% 
of the urbanized area’s population 
(579,999/1,252,987).
3
Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s characteristics align well 
with the eight USDOT characteristics for 
a Smart City. The population is 579,999 
in a metropolitan area of greater than 1.2 
million people, and since 2010 over 40,000 
people have moved to the City. While it has 
a large land area (606.41 square miles), 
a significant part of the City has a dense 
urban population typical for a mid-sized 
American city, and part of that is in the 
subpart of the City included in the Site Map 
of the Smart City proposal.  A geographically 
large city it has 8,000 lane miles of streets, 
has a multimodal public transportation 
system (EMBARK), and probably has more 
fire stations (35) and more linear miles of 
interstate highways than nearly any city 
in America. This is a City that thinks big 
and yet addresses the small, fine-grain 
community needs across its jurisdictional 
span. The area represents a significant 
portion (46%) of the overall population 
of the urbanized area based on the 2010 
Census data.
In addition to the eight characteristics, 
the Smart City outcomes here are also 
expected to meet the USDOT’s three 
stated characteristics; outcomes of 
improving safety, enhancing mobility, and 
addressing climate change.  Climate change 
improvements are best achieved nationwide 
and locally by fewer or even no vehicle trips, 
as in the case of having goods delivered 
or by walking /cycling a short distance to 
pick them up. Fewer trips in private cars and 
trucks reduce engine emission and help 
implicitly meet that Smart City objective by 
high customer usage of the streetcar and 
bus rapid transit (BRT) systems which are 
the core of this proposal.  Such connected 
transit vehicles and the routeside sensors USDOT’s
Characteristics
also improve safety and enhance mobility. 
The City’s vision also fosters integration 
among the twelve USDOT Smart City 
elements.  
Oklahoma City (OKC) has been on the rise 
for a long time and has an environment very 
conducive to demonstrating the proposed 
strategies, as noted below. Commercial 
real estate firm CBRE looked to see 
which cities were growing their technology 
markets. Last year, no city had a faster 
rate of growth than Oklahoma City, as it is 
up 38 percent. This may in part be due to 
the smart, open people. Travel and Leisure 
Magazine put OKC on their list as one of 
the friendliest travel destinations. According 
to the Brookings Institute, we have one 
of the lowest rates of income inequality in 
the country. Also in terms of inclusiveness, 
New Geography Magazine last year named 
us as the top ranked city in the country for 
Veterans.  In January, USA Today came out 
with a list: The 14 places you have to visit 
in 2016 and Oklahoma City made the list. 
Entrepreneur Magazine put together a list of 
the top 25 cities worth moving to if you want 
to launch a business and OKC was number 
one on this list.
The City Council has adopted six priorities 
( http://www.okc.gov/priorities/) which are 
the overarching policy guide for the City, 
along with planokc.  The City Council is very 
stable, and the Mayor and the City Manager 
have been in their positions since 2004 and 
2000, respectively. There is great stability 
and productivity among the department 
heads and key staff. Oklahoma City is a full-
service City with nearly 4,700 employees 
and a total budget of $ 1.2 billion. The 
capacity shown by the above and through 4
Oklahoma City, OKthe hundreds of millions of dollars carefully 
expended on the MAPS projects and 
through City trust authorities is evidence 
of the continuity of committed leadership 
and capacity to carry out the Smart City 
demonstration.
The six priorities stated below also help 
define the local vision of a Smart City, and 
the Smart City Challenge relates very closely 
to # 3 and #5. The priorities are grounded 
in the lessons of the City’s history and the 
values of inclusiveness, mutual respect and 
self-reliance.
Having a workforce and business climate 
that reinforces regional economic strength 
is also important and so smart Workforce 
Development and smart infrastructure is 
priorities in the local vison of a Smart city. 
Google Fiber announced in fall 2015 that is 
was seriously considering entering the OKC 
market. Verizon honored the City with its 
Smart City award in September 2015. 
The following companies have thrived and 
grown here, along with many others: upgraded nearly every school and their tech 
infrastructure, Citywide. The relatively poor 
health outcomes in Oklahoma, especially 
in the lower income urban zip codes, are 
another challenge and part of why the 
Smart City area connects to some health 
campuses and why it reaches into some of 
the City’s more challenged zip codes. 
All the above aligns well with the USDOT 
characteristics for a Smart City. The six 
Council adopted priorities are: 
1. Provide a Safe and Secure Community
2. Maintain Strong Financial Management
3. Develop a Transportation System That 
Works for All Citizens
4. Promote Thriving Neighborhoods
5. Support High Quality Public Education
6. Enhance Recreation Opportunities and 
Community Wellness
EMBARK, the City’s public transportation 
agency, has a service area in excess of 
200 square miles.  EMBARK is part of 
the Central Oklahoma Transportation and 
Parking Authority (COTPA). The public 
transportation system’s 21 fixed routes, 
the ferryboat service, and the Spokies 
bike share will soon be joined by a six-
car $120+million rail streetcar system to 
start operation in 2018. Serving downtown 
including a newly renovation intermodal 
transportation hub.  
In October, 2014 EMBARK launched an 
open data portal that provides access to 
static and real-time GTFS feeds by way 
of individual API-Keys. The API keys 
provide developers, stakeholders, and the 
community at-large with transit open data 
sets. On the private sector side, services like 
Uber, Lyft, iTN America and car sharing are 
growing.•	Boeing

A national look at the 350 largest metros

The signs and priorities are all signs 
and characteristics of Oklahoma City's 
greatness. However, the City’s emphasis 
on inclusivity, public health, and public 
education are also very important. To 
that end, MAPS for kids replaced or 5

Oklahoma City, OKT1. Urban Automation 
“Automated transportation – self-driving vehicles 
coupled with smart infrastructure, driver assisted 
automation could reduce fuel use and congestion  
enabling closer spacing and narrower lanes for 
vehicles, etc.”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City of Oklahoma City in 2009 began, 
and has since completed, integrating all 
traffic control intersections into a centrally 
connected, centrally managed ITS system.  
Each intersection controller is capable of 
far more automation providing increased 
value to the citizenry through data collection 
and dissemination back into the system 
providing, then distributed via application 
back to the citizenry. 
Possible  Demonstration Strategies
•	Self-driving (or automated) streetcar 
as part of MAPS downtown streetcar 
project. The $ 120 million Downtown 
OKC rail streetcar project starts 
operation in 2018. The self-driving 
streetcar would be the first in America 
and would safely reduce labor cost. The 
technology would be developed jointly by 
Brookville Equipment Corporation, OKC, 
and a tech firm (perhaps Google).  bus technology allows a live experiment 
for the refinement of the technology, 
standard operating practices (SOP’s), 
and more. 
•	Self-Driving Smart Car Loops. The three 
proposed self-driving smart car loops 
require the car to “learn” a limited route. 
Each does a loop-route that is not cost 
effective to do with a new all-day bus 
route, and they are in various parts of 
town.  Two loops benefit the schedule 
adherence of an adjacent bus route, 
and others help with frail people more in 
needing of a curb-to-curb rip.  The three, 
prospectively, are: 
1. One to Francis Tuttle Career tech to link 
it to the northwest anchor end of the 
electric bus BRT 
2. The second starts as a “vet link”  linking 
the Santa Fe hub anchor of the BRT 
to the Oklahoma  Health Center in 
northeast Oklahoma City with its 
Veterans Administration (VA)  hospital. 
Once the service has a longer record, it 
may be opened up beyond Veterans to 
serve the general population. 
3. A third is a car “loop” near SW 59th 
and Western that eliminates the slow, 
circuitous maneuvering of bus Route 
13 through a neighborhood for a few 
older and frail passengers each day.  
This loop serves two “senior-only” public 
housing complexes and can get them 
to the stores and INTEGRIS hospital at 
SE 44th and Western, as well as to safe 
stops of the Route 13. 
•	Self-driving buses for a dedicated bus-
only lane segment (about a mile or two) 
of the Northwest Expressway as part 
of the BRT project . The self-driving 9
Oklahoma City, OKT2. Connected Vehicles
“Use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-
infrastructure (V2I) communications”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
Today, V2V can be accomplished by 
gathering metrics from the current 
production City infrastructure and providing 
the information back to drivers through use 
of an application that is accessed via smart 
device: phone or tablet. Any information 
gathered today and then accessed via smart 
device can be seamlessly incorporated into 
vehicle technology, Wi-Fi and dash-mounted 
LCD. The goal would be to enhance existing 
production infrastructure to gather V2V and 
V2I information that is then distributed back 
via application.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	NW BRT Electric buses that have 
sensors providing continuous pavement 
and weather conditions and traffic 
congestion monitoring
•	NW BRT buses and fire and ambulance 
vehicles with collision avoidance 
sensors  with Dedicated Short Range 
Communication (DSRC) technology
•	NW BRT electric buses that have 
sensors that “request” the bus to stop 
due to a request by an on-board or even 
roadside passenger with a disability 
•	Enable electric vehicle-charging grid-
to-vehicle (G2V) wireless inductive 
charging technology at designated 
EMBARK parking garages, and 
potentially on one lane at a designated 
NW Expressway intersection.T3. Intelligent, Sensor-based   
Infrastructure
“Collect and report real time data regarding traffic, 
pedestrian, bicyclist, environmental, etc”.
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City’s current ITS system is fully capable 
of a variety of information gathering sources 
such as:
•	Public Works, Water, and Transit vehicles 
attached with sensors to assess road 
conditions, real-time temperatures, 
provide back current “drive speed”. 
Additionally, for the purpose of de-icing, 
plowing, and proactively being prepared 
to do so. Via this sensor information, 
“geo-fences” could be transmitted to City 
and other vehicles to warn motorists and 
possibly automatically engage traction 
control in response to the advertised 
potentially slick surfaces in geo-fenced 
areas.
•	The City and its Public Work’s 
Department is already committed to 
traffic signal priority (TSP) for buses in 
various locations, and for BRT. 
•	All buses are already equipped with 
an array of smart technology, such as 
infrared passenger counters linked to 
GPS data, on-board voice annunciators, 
and more.
•	Traffic intersections equipped with Wi-Fi 
detection and algorithm assessment to 
determine traffic delays/jams.
•	In Car “Storm/Tornado” Warnings; a 
driver listening to music at a high volume 
in their car may not be fully aware of a 
pending weather threat. It is possible to 
broadcast the City of Oklahoma City’s 
Public Safety Early Warning system 
through an app based either on a 
smartphone platform, other device, or in 10
Oklahoma City, OKa smart car. This way a person needs not 
rely solely on the outdoors ground-based 
audible siren system. 
•	Transit bus stop platforms equipped with 
“call buttons” when activated request 
the bus to stop. Not activated, the bus 
need not stop decreasing drive time and 
emissions
•	Aside from these, the city already as 
number of crosswalks that “flash” to 
warn motorists once a person walks past 
the sensors mounted in the bollards, and 
more.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Roadside sensors which detect the NW 
electric BRT buses and then trigger 
overhead mast-arm signs (imagine LED 
signs with green circles and red x’s) to 
tell motorists to clear out of the BRT 
lane since a bus is approaching. 
•	Roadside sensors which detect NW BRT 
buses and communicate to visually and/
or hearing impared (communicated in a 
medium preferred by the passenger). 
•	Traffic signal priority for BRT.
I4. Urban Analytics
“Use of analytics to address complex urban 
challenges (e.g. personal safety and mobility, 
network efficiency, and environmental 
sustainability) and/or measure the performance of 
a transportation network.”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City’s ITS system can be enhanced 
to provide way-finding for all modes of 
transportation (pedestrian, cyclist, transit 
rider, private automobile, etc.) via an 
application that could be accessed via smart 
device, positioning to then be integrated 
into vehicles equipped with Wi-Fi and dash 
mounted LCDs.Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Work with OKC I.T. and private sector to 
develop systems to better track patterns 
and carbon footprints of users of any 
small-party vehicle serving as a taxi, 
Uber, Lyft, car share (and so forth), to 
help determine if a new public transit 
route or other service is needed. 
•	Work with OKC I.T. and US Fleet tracking 
to better track paratransit vans and 
amend the operators’ routing and pick-
ups in a dynamic timeframe, especially in 
ridersheds near the NW BRT. 
•	Provide open source data so that 
travelers create apps and gain up-to-
date mapped info about pedestrian 
crossing signals that are absent or out-
of-service.
•	Provide open source data so that 
travelers gain even easier access to info 
on bus detours near where they went to 
board.
I5. User Focused Mobility   
Services and Choices
“Strategies, initiatives, and services that increase 
transportation choices and options by supporting 
and improving mobility for all travelers, such 
as advanced  traveler information systems that 
provide real-time traffic, transit, parking, and other 
transportation-related information.  Also includes 
bike share and car share – mobility on demand”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City’s infrastructure is positioned today 
to “feed the machine” information required 
for an informed citizenry.  This can be 
accomplished today via a smart device that 
can then be integrated into a car with Wi-Fi 
and dash LCD to inform citizens of such 
alerts as parking availability, city events and 
updates on various modes of transportation. 11
Oklahoma City, OKWeGoLook  (https://wegolook.com/) is an 
innovative sharing-economy startup from 
Oklahoma. WeGoLook (https://wegolook.
com/how-it-works) is part of the sharing 
economy and started on the concept of, “I 
had a bad experience on eBay, and how 
can I fix that to put some eyes on what I 
am actually buying and reduce my risk as a 
purchaser?”  It can also be seen as a way 
for people to evaluate various mobility on 
demand (MOD) approaches and various 
smart deployments used here and around 
America.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Develop user-friendly strategies, ones 
that even the less savvy can and will 
want to learn.  These can increase 
transportation choices and options 
for aging Americans and persons 
with disabilities by advanced traveler 
information systems that provide real-
time info about shared rides (Uber, Lyft, 
etc.), nearby taxis, the local iTN vehicles, 
EMBARK’s STEP and CMP vans, worker 
vanpools and more.    
•	Develop other related Mobility on 
Demand (MOD) software platforms, 
such as  for bikeshare.
I6. Urban Delivery and Logistics
“use of data or deployment technology”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
Oklahoma is one of the key cross-roads 
west of the Mississippi with large volumes  
of from, to, within, and through urban freight 
flows. Like any other city, OKC’s economy is 
largely based on efficient freight logistics for 
citizens and businesses. 
By following the sharing economy concept, 
it can  develop a suite of web and mobile 
APPs and relevant ICT technologies to drastically improve the efficiency and cost 
of urban goods movement, including U-Ship, 
U-Store, U-Buy, U-Park, and U-Receive,  in 
the Smart zone or in the broader city.  Each 
of  these would be based on voluntary and 
screened matching of individual supply 
(resources) and demand (needs) perhaps 
better than UberRUSH.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	U-Ship - So far, the standard urban 
goods movement is based on delivery 
by logistics firms on highways. However, 
there are many privately owned cars, 
vans, floral delivery vehicles, and other 
delivery trucks that could participate 
in shipping goods for households and 
businesses. The web and mobile APP 
would allow people/businesses with 
vacant vehicles to match to people/
businesses who need shipping. This 
would reduce freight traffic and cost. 
This would virtually allow everyone to be 
able to SHIP goods for everyone else in 
the city.  
•	U-Store - Storage and warehousing is 
an important part of any urban goods 
movement. U-Store web and mobile 
APP would match individual and 
business storage spaces (ranging from 
room/garage/land to distribution center) 
for those who need store goods. This 
would virtually allow everyone to be able 
to STORE goods for everyone else in the 
city.
•	U-Buy -  A huge portion of urban traffic 
is shopping related including to and 
from local retail stores. This could 
conceivably be linked to Oklahoma-
based “WeGoLook.” On line shopping 
or e-commerce drastically changes the 
traditional local retailing. However, U-Buy 
proposed here could revolutionize the 
retailing and at the same time reduce 12
Oklahoma City, OKurban traffic. U-Buy web and mobile 
APP would match local shoppers in retail 
stores to those living nearby who are not 
in stores but want to buy goods in real 
time. The shoppers will buy and deliver 
goods for to the nearby households. This 
would virtually allow anyone to be able to 
BUY goods for some others in the city.
•	U-Park -  One major problem in a city 
is parking, which may be hard to find 
and costly. The U-Park web and mobile 
APP would store all parking spaces in 
Oklahoma City and match the spaces 
to those who need in real time. This is 
based on a  sensor-based technologies 
to monitor all parking spaces with easy 
maintenance and low cost. This would 
virtually allow people  to be  able to 
locate a suitable PARKING space in 
advance. 
•	U-Receive -  One major problem in 
urban goods is multiple deliveries due 
to households/Businesses not in. This 
U-Receive web and mobile APP will 
allow households/businesses to sign up 
their trusted neighbors and match their 
presence to good delivery. This would 
guarantee only one delivery to receive 
goods/packages for every household/
business.  
The above sharing economy web and 
mobile application suite, plus proper ICT 
technologies, can be developed together 
with the ITS passenger transportation 
(both auto and public transit) for the same 
Oklahoma City test site and its performance 
can be compared with households and 
businesses not using these application 
suites to capture the differences and 
improvements.
Work with OKC I.T. and others to link 
shopping services to the COTPA STEP van

Partnering Opportunities
“Leveraging creative strategic partnerships that 
draw in stakeholders”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City of Oklahoma City builds, and 
has been recognized for building, the  
“successful models”.  Verizon awarded 
Oklahoma City its Smart City award on 
September 1, 2015. Any of the technology 
partners with which the City of Oklahoma 
City has engaged to develop the existing 
Smart City model currently in production 
have the incentive to fully engage with the 
City to further develop solutions.  Some 
current examples are:

Possible Demonstration Strategies
For the City of Oklahoma City to work with 
various companies and the engineering 
colleges of OU and OSU is the heart of 
this. Not all of these potential partners have 
been able to meet with the City yet. Some 
prospective examples: 
•	Self-driving (or automated) streetcar:  
Brookville Equipment Corporation 
is the firm whose streetcars will be 
used. Dallas (200 miles south) has 
had a very positive experience with 
the Brookville streetcars overall and 
even with their onboard energy storage 
devices.  The City would partner with 
them and conceivably with Google or 
another firm with some proven “self-
driving” technology, as el as with some 
secondary partners such a university.  
•	Energy Absorbing Roadways (EARs): 
OGE (Oklahoma Gas and Electric) and 
Oklahoma City’s existing relationship 
with General Electric (GE), and  with an 
University Transportation Center (UTC) 
would be a way to pilot some Energy 
Absorbing Roadways (EARs) that 
actually “generate” electricity from the 
kinetic  energy of passing vehicles. The 
energy could be used to power some 
NW BRT stations’ lighting and other 
power needs. The City could also partner 
with ODOT, the Oklahoma Turnpike 
Authority (OTA) via the Oklahoma City 
Public Works Department to also install 14

I8. Smart Grid, Roadway 
Electrification, and Electric 
Vehicles
“Leverage the smart grid – a programmable and 
efficient energy transmission and distribution 
system”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
The City already has a limited deployment 
of charging stations with the limitation to 
further expansion being budget.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Enable electric vehicle-charging [grid-to-
vehicle (G2V) wireless inductive  
charging technology at a EMBARK  
garages and perhaps on one lane at 
some busy NW expressway intersections 
(Classen at NW 23rd): one allows 
electric vehicles to charge their batteries 
wirelessly while the vehicle is parked, 
and the other while either stopped or in 
motion along that part of the roadway
•	As stated in Element 7 above, work with 
the engineering colleges of OU and 
OSU, General Electric (GE), OG&E or 
with a University Transportation Center 
(UTC) to pilot some Energy Absorbing 
Roadways (EARs) that actually generate 
electricity from passing vehicle for some 
NW BRT stations
•	“Green” street lighting integrated into 
the ITSI9. Connected, Involved Citizens
“Public outreach and connectivity”
Oklahoma City’s Initiatives
This element speaks to “incentivizing” 
participation. The key here is “How do 
Wi-Fi providers accomplish “Opting in” 
for participation today?” The City has 
researched and discussed the various ways 
in which a citizen would have incentive to 
participate. Once the app is established and 
available, the value thereof will be easily and 
quickly grasped. Our biggest “salesman” 
may well be  word-of-mouth. However, 
vendor participation with discounts, access 
incentives to events in City owned facilities 
(Chesapeake, Cox, State Fair), the list goes 
on and on. The only limitation becomes how 
extensive the underpinning app needs to be .
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Create attractive incentives and a staffed 
agency and an automated “humanlike” 
software system that tutors the older 
adult “how” to become a connected, 
involved citizen to use the new software/
systems and about the wide range of 
mobility options 
•	Engage and inform citizens along with 
Google Fiber by deploying hardware, 
software, and open data platforms in an 
effort to increase personal mobility. 
•	Spawn a data exchange for 
crowdsourced data to provide 
communication conduits through mobile 
technologies to connect citizens with city 
mobility-related entities15
Oklahoma City, OKintersections.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Work with OKC IT and other parties 
to implement the required Dedicated 
Short Range Communication(DSRC) 
technology operating in the 5.9GHz 
range in any demonstrations of 
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-
to-infrastructure  (V2I) applications, 
to advance information and 
communications technology (ICT) in 
accordance with the aims of the USDOT 
Smart City challenge
•	Develop local ICT consisting of unified 
communications and the integration of 
telecommunications, computers as well 
as necessary but affordable enterprise 
software, storage, and visualization 
systems, which enable users to 
access, store, transmit, and manipulate 
information. All done with an eye to 
citizens’ privacy and security.  
•	Projects to ensure both physical security 
of the deployed devices and security 
for non-DSRC communications will be 
addressed for self-driving vehicles and 
other applications.

Any pre-existing standard, CVRIA, National 
ITS Architecture, etc must be  
considered and employed during further 
enhancement of the City’s existing  
production infrastructure.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Work with City ITS, Google Fiber, 
and local universities to use the 
National ITS Architecture along with

proposals. It expresses our community’s 
vision and priorities, and describes, where, 
how, and in some cases, when development 
should occur.  The plan emphasizes seven 
themes and focused on sustainable, 
compact growth scenarios:
•	Develop a transportation system that 
works for everyone.
•	Increase housing choice and diversity for 
all lifestyles.
•	Build and urban environment that 
facilitates health and wellness.
•	Develop great places that attract 
people and catalyze development and 
innovation.
•	Ensure safe, stable, attractive and vibrant 
neighborhoods.
•	Develop efficiently to achieve fiscal 
sustainability and improve our quality of 
life.
•	Preserve rural character and natural 
resources.
Possible Demonstration Strategies
•	Implement the Transit Oriented 
Development (TOD) policies and 
regulations as recommended in

Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Risk Mitigation Plan
In regard to key technical, policy, and 
institutional risks associated with the 
deployment vision. In any case, we are 
confident all risks can be mitigated. 
In terms of policy risks, for example, there 
will be a wide range of traffic laws which 
will require review and potential amendment 
in order to prepare the public and minimize 
risk. These will be necessary in regards 
to both BRT and streetcar, but also as 
warnings to motorists about the locations 
of certain Smart infrastructure located just 
ahead.  Many of these will relate to public 
safety. The technical risks will need to be 
developed alongside the technology, vehicle, 
smartphone, and other private sector 
vendors. 
One institutional concern is proper staffing 
to accomplish the additional City roles 
called for in order to manage the $50m 
grant. Whether the role of the Planning 
Department, I.T., EMBARK, or Public Works, 
each needs to be able to hire more full time 
staff or contracted staff in order to mitigate 
the risk. 
Any conversation about providing an 
effective umbrella to citizens requires 
gathering data, assimilating data and 
disseminating data in an easily accessible 
manner to provide the answer of the 
moment needed by a citizen accessing the 
app. Oklahoma City’s 
Partners & 
Stakeholders
This section outlines team partners, 
key stakeholders, and demonstration 
governance processes. It describes 
existing and future public and/or private 
partnerships, including university research 
partnerships.
The City of Oklahoma City will work closely 
with COTPA as a key partner.  COTPA’s 
transit agency “face” is EMBARK, and it 
will help implement various demonstration 
strategies.  Within the City its Public Works 
Department, the Planning Department, 
the Information Technology Department, 
Transportation and Parking Department, 
Municipal Counselor, Department of 
Finance, Public Safety Department, and the 
MAPS Project Office staff will also play a 
key role.  
Outside key stakeholders include the 
agencies that were consulted during the 
preparation of the grant application as well 
as other companies and agencies.  In fact, 
the City hosted two meetings of potential 
partners on January 20 and 26 and the 
University of Oklahoma Center for Intelligent 
Transportation Systems.  Attendance 
sheets from these are available on request.  
Some have already provided letters of 
commitment, and other stakeholders and 
partners are at varying stages of discussion 
with the City and COTPA. Aside from major 
private sector firms with an OKC presence 
such as General Electric, there would be 
prospective partnerships for workforce 
development and social inclusion. 
One, for example could be with Francis 
Tuttle Career tech’s Automotive Technology 
Program so they could perhaps help with 18
Oklahoma City, OKthe University of Oklahoma’s ITS center, and 
also three City staff as ex- officio members. 
The Board will meet at least six times per 
year and will be advisory to the City Council. 
The prospective list of project supporters 
and stakeholders is larger than the Advisory 
Board and has emerged so far to include: 
•	Association of Central Oklahoma 
Governments (ACOG)
•	Boeing
•	Brookville Equipment Corporation
•	City of Warr Acres
•	Clean Cities Coalition (of ACOG)
•	Dell
•	Devon Energy
•	Downtown OKC Inc. 
•	Fed Ex

•	Oklahoma City Housing Authority
•	Oklahoma City Economic Development 
Alliance
•	Oklahoma City University
•	Oklahoma Department of Transportation
•	Oklahoma Turnpike Authority
•	Shiels Obletz Johnson (SOJ)
•	Southern Plains Transportation Center 
(USDOT Region VI)  
•	Steer, Davies, Gleave
•	US Fleet Tracking
•	University of Oklahoma 
•	College of Architecture, RCPL Division 
•	University of Oklahoma 
•	Center for Intelligent Transportation 
Systems of the School of Electrical and 
Computer Engineeringsome storage and servicing of the self-
driving car loop from BRT to there. Another 
could be a “Coding School” in the Ralph 
Ellison Library at 23rd and Martin Luther 
King Blvd. for teenagers. The potential 
for partnerships to the public housing 
complexes for the older adults as has 
been addressed elsewhere. NewView 
Oklahoma’s letter shows their role in the 
blind community and the community at large. 
There will be a need for only a modest 
demonstration project governance process, 
and the City will establish a Smart City Zone 
Advisory Board to be staffed by either the 
Planning Department or in another single 
department. Only a small governance 
structure is needed because at 600+ 
square miles, the City has so many of the 
metropolitan area’s regional trust authorities, 
and encompasses all but less than a square 
mile of the Smart City zone. Also, because 
Oklahoma City’s City Council and its various 
appointed bodies already function as an 
effective well integrated whole.  The City 
has had experience with university research 
partnerships, such as through the OU 
Institute of Quality Communities (IQC) and 
looks forward to working with the Southern 
Plains Transportation Center.  
The Zone’s Advisory Board will be an 
ad hoc board designed to exist through 
implementation for at least two years 
after the close of the grant to help ensure 
accountability on the various projects 
implemented.  Its more specific structure 
will be determined further in the Finalist 
application due in May 2016, but it should 
contain at least three elected officials, as 
well as a representative of the Chamber of 
Commerce and from five private companies, 
COTPA, at least one nonprofit, ODOT ITS 
staff, the Southern Plains Transportation 
Center (USDOT Region VI), the Association 
of Central Oklahoma Governments (ACOG), 19
Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Existing Conditions
Lane Miles  
Oklahoma City is in the top five largest 
continental United States cities in 
geographic area and spreads into four 
counties: Oklahoma, Canadian, Cleveland 
and Pottawatomie. To accommodate this 
geographic area, Oklahoma City has 1,273 
lane miles of Arterials, 478 lane miles of 
Freeways, 3,057 lane miles of residential 
streets and 93 lane miles of streets in 
downtown Oklahoma City.  
Transit Services  
The City of Oklahoma City and parts of 
various suburbs are provided transit services 
through EMBARK in a service area larger 
than 200 square miles of the Oklahoma 
City Urbanized Area (UZA).  The Central 
Oklahoma Transportation and Parking 
Authority (COTPA) is the transit authority’s 
legal name and through EMBARK it 
currently operates twenty-one (21) local 
routes and an express route to/from 
Norman to the south. Because COTPA is 
an authority of the City, the ability to work 
closely with the I.T., Public Works, and other 
City departments has a good track record. 
This harmonious relationship is anticipated 
to continue should COTPA/EMBARK 
emerge as an independent regional transit 
authority in 5-10 years. 
COTPA employs a fleet of 59 buses for 
EMBARK, plus 24 paratransit vans, an 
8 station bike share program, and three 
ferry boats. . By mid-2015, as a part of 
COTPA’s 2004 I.T.S. Plan, COTPA had 
added Wi-Fi to all the buses for use by the 
customers. Since 2013, EMBARK has 
used GPS tracking to manage the buses.  
The EMBARK website features on-line trip planning for customers.
In October, 2014 EMBARK launched an 
open data portal that provides access to 
static and real-time GTFS feeds by way of 
individual API-Keys. The API keys allow 
COTPA to know who is accessing data, 
while providing developers, stakeholders, 
and the community at-large with transit 
open data sets. This machine-readable data 
is accessible, discoverable and usable by the 
public for entrepreneurship and innovation.
In 2013 COTPA hired the firm of Nelson 
Nygaard and Associates to evaluate 
the bus route network and to make 
recommendations to streamline the fixed 
route network and help almost all routes 
maintain a 30 minute frequency. In April 
2014 most of the route network changes 
were made, and ridership has increased 
4-9% in year-to-year comparisons by month.  
In addition, four new night-time fixed routes 
have been added, as well as nighttime 
complementary paratransit.   
COTPA’s transit plans for the future include 
bus rapid transit (BRT), traffic signal priority 
(TSP), and a funded modern rail streetcar 
project. The most likely initial high capacity 
transit transporting passengers to and from 
the Downtown is the 8-12 mile Northwest 
BRT corridor which will use a combination 
of Classen Boulevard and the Northwest 
Expressway, as mentioned elsewhere in 
the Smart City application. COTPA will be 
responsible for operations of the $100+ 
million MAPS3 rail streetcar circulator which 
will start serving the Downtown in 2018, 
and this will feature a variety of advanced 
technologies. 
COTPA contracts with a firm called Airport 20
Oklahoma City, OKExpress for the operation of some night-
time point-deviation routes called Link for 
EMBARK.  The routes serve a designated 
area and stop at major activity centers on 
a regular schedule.  Passengers call to 
schedule a pick up at the curb for non-
scheduled stops.  The three routes meet up 
on the hour with the four EMBARK night 
time fixed routes at the Hudson Avenue 
Transit Center so that timed transfers are 
possible to and from fixed route buses and 
other Link routes.
The circa 1930 Santa Fe RR Depot will 
eventually come on-line to serve as a transit 
center in addition to the Hudson Avenue 
Transit Center. The downtown Santa Fe Hub 
received a $13.6 million TIGER V grant, and 
is intended to someday serve the planned 
regional commuter rail and other modes. In 
the meantime, it will anchor the northwest 
BRT corridor, a corridor which gained federal 
support as one of only two transit corridors 
in American selected for the USDOT’s 2015 
Public Health and Transportation Corridor 
(PHATCP) framework beta test. The Santa 
Fe Station will be served by the streetcar in 
2018, and will be a location for other modes 
including bike share, car sharing, and more.
in regional transportation planning and also 
manages the region’s carpool/ rideshare 
program.  The service’s database   matches 
commuters who are able to share a ride to 
and from work, school or other destinations. 
EMBARK has been exploring the start of a 
smart vanpool program with various private 
vendors.  
The non-profit ITNCentral Oklahoma and 
RSVP are two shared use services in the 
local sharing economy.  The former is 
mobility on demand “lite” program  (http://
www.itncentraloklahoma.org/ ) and is an 
affiliate of the national network called 
ITNAmerica. It is less expensive than Uber 
or Lyft for customers and is a bit more 
sophisticated than COTPA’s partnership with 
the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program 
(RSVP) Provide-A-Ride program.  Provide-
a-Ride originated locally and is a donation-
based service utilizing a few dozen older 
adult volunteers monthly who use their own 
vehicles and RSVP’s insurance to transport 
frail or elderly persons to and from medical 
appointments.
Also, in the private sector the transportation 
sharing economy services like Uber, Lyft, 
and Enterprise car sharing are growing 
in this region. These provide much 
mobility on demand (MOD).  The sharing 
economy, however, is also growing in non-
transportation sectors that could play a role 
in MOD. For example, “WeGoLook is one 
of the most exciting startups in Oklahoma,” 
according to former State Treasurer Scott 
Meacham.  WeGoLook (https://wegolook.
com/how-it-works) is part of the sharing 
economy and started on the concept of, “I 
had a bad experience on eBay, and how 
can I fix that to put some eyes on what I 
am actually buying and reduce my risk as 
a purchaser?”  Once one thinks about the 
WeGoLook sharing economy model and the 
nationwide network of “Lookers,” one sees it Shared Use Mobility Services
The Metropolitan Planning Organization 
(MPO) known as ACOG is a great partner 21
Oklahoma City, OKas way for people to have a resource that no 
one else has to help evaluate various MOD 
approaches and various smart deployments 
used here and around America.
ITC and ITS
With regards to Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT), Oklahoma 
City utilizes ITC to address congestion 
management issues with the integrated 
traffic controls systems that have been 
implemented at 748 intersections 
throughout the 600+ square mile city.  This 
application reduces vehicle travel times 
and minimizes emissions.  The OKC Public 
Works Department’s Traffic Design and 
Engineering Section is involved in planning, 
Finally, EMBARK is also responsible for 
the only municipal bike share program in 
the region, Spokies. Spokies was assumed 
by EMBARK in 2014 after having been 
managed for several years by the downtown 
business association. In 2016, EMBARK 
will be replacing the fleet with smarter bikes 
and a better customer software interface.
designing, and implementing new traffic 
control devices and improving existing traffic 
control devices. The City has a sophisticated 
control room from which remote control 
can be achieved when needed.  The  Data 
Collection and Planning Section provides 
staff for the Unified Planning Work Program 
in cooperation with the Association of 
Central Oklahoma Governments, the 
Oklahoma Department of Transportation, 
and the Central Oklahoma Transportation 
and Parking Authority.  
The OU Center for ITS, one of our team 
members, has collaborated with ODOT to 
develop and deploy a main TMC that is 
currently operational and is located off the 
first floor lobby at ODOT headquarters.  
In partnership with ODOT, OU has also 
developed and implemented the only fully 
virtual TMC in the United States; it has been 
operational for years and there are virtual 
22
Oklahoma City, OK
TMC “ITS consoles” already operational in 
several locations in OKC.  The Oklahoma 
virtual TMC is documented and has been 
recognized in a recent (Nov 2014) FHWA 
Technical Report.   
There is also substantial ITS infrastructure 
on the highways in OKC metro that OU 
has developed in partnership with ODOT.  
These are all state-level assets that 
currently operate independently from the 
city owned and operated infrastructure.  
Achieving higher levels of integration 
and interoperability between state and 
municipal ITS assets is included in the City’s 
Demonstration Project.  The successful 
integration between ODOT’s ITS assets and 
OKC’s ITS assets could obviously generalize 
to other cities.
23
Oklahoma City, OK
Smart Grid Infrastructure  
The Central Oklahoma Transportation 
and Parking Authority (COTPA) manage 
most of the downtown multi-level parking 
garages available to the public.  Aside from 
allowing the monthly customers gratis 
access to EMBARK’s Downtown Discover 
circulator bus, COTPA has already installed 
stations for electrical vehicle charging in 
one garage. COTPA and the City have been 
in preliminary discussions for siting a high 
energy charger station in the Downtown. 
COTPA has met with a vendor to explore 
adding other electric car charging stations in 
the garages. 
There are several electrical vehicle charging 
stations here as the map below indicates, 
and usage of electric vehicles should 
mirror national trends. There are perhaps 
not as many charging stations as there 
are fueling sites for compressed natural 
gas (CNG) automobiles and trucks, but 
there are enough to serve many electric 
vehicles. CNG vehicles are very popular 
with households here due in part to the 
major oil and gas companies headquartered 
here such as Devon, Chesapeake, and 
Continental Resources and yet this shows 
the local interest in moving beyond the 
gasoline combustion engine.  
In addition, Oklahoma City has built several 
CNG fueling facilities with public access 
and is in the process of converting much of 
the City’s automobile, truck and bus fleets to 
CNG.
24
Oklahoma City, OKThe City of Oklahoma City in 2009 began, 
and has since completed, integrating all 
traffic control intersections into a centrally 
connected, centrally managed ITS system. 
The initial intent of this initiative was to 
reduce drive time and lower emissions. 
The deployment today encompasses 748 
City intersections. The goal of reducing 
drive times and, subsequently gasoline 
consumption and reduced emissions, 
has been accomplished. However, the 
opportunity to further enhance this goal 
is available through addition of an adjunct 
application that removes the human element 
and makes real intersection-to-intersection 
automated communication to move cars 
more rapidly across corridors based on 
addressing real-time the presence or 
absence of traffic in the opposing direction. 
Each intersection controller is capable of 
far more automation providing increased 
value to the citizenry through data collection 
and dissemination back into the system 
providing, then distributed via application 
back to the citizenry. The City is currently 
engaged in pilot programs to explore the 
addition of available modules. Specifically 
pilots underway are in the areas of CCTV 
and in-vehicle WiFi assessment: regardless 
of the WiFi presence being on-board vehicle 
or in-car carried smart phone/tablet.
The City’s current production Parking 
application is capable of “advising” real-
time space availability. Lack of funding  is 
an obstacle to exploring more aggressively 
all that the app is capable of collecting and 
feeding back into the central system.
The limitation for V2V today is the current 
availability of the vehicles themselves. It 
is possible today to enhance existing City of Oklahoma City production applications 
to “be ready” for such a time that vehicles 
“catch up” to what is possible. Today, 
V2V can be accomplished by gathering 
metrics from the current production City 
infrastructure and providing the information 
back to drivers through use of an application 
that is accessed via smart device: phone 
or tablet. Any information gathered today 
and then accessed via smart device can 
be seamlessly incorporated into vehicle 
technology, WiFi and dash-mounted LCD, 
when the manufactures are proven the 
value of the information provided.  The goal 
would be to enhance existing production 
infrastructure to gather V2V and V2I 
information that is then distributed back via 
application. 
Among the sharing candidates already 
available for use and growth is the transit 
passenger data. In October, 2014 EMBARK 
launched an open data portal that provides 
access to static and real-time GTFS 
feeds by way of individual API-Keys. The 
API keys allow COTPA to know who is 
accessing data, while providing developers, 
stakeholders, and the community at-
large with transit open data sets. This 
machine-readable data is accessible, 
discoverable and usable by the public to 
fuel entrepreneurship and innovation. This 
is just one example of the local government 
commitment to integrating with the sharing 
economy. 
Discussing the concept of a “virtual” 
dedicated lane for bus traffic, the City’s 
current production ITS system is capable, 
today, of providing “priority” to emergency 
dispatched public safety vehicles. This is 
accomplished by “clearing” intersections Oklahoma City’s 
Data Collection
25
Oklahoma City, OKof existing traffic prior to the public safety 
vehicle arriving through traffic signal priority 
(TSP). This same, currently production 
technology is being leveraged now to serve 
buses at high-priority locations. 
The existing production Traffic ITS 
deployment has many options for detection: 
radar, CCTV, infrared, thermal, side-sensors, 
WiFi detection. Some of these are currently 
in production, in pilot or scheduled for pilot 
at various City intersections. 
The key to success and a key for which 
the City of Oklahoma City today is already 
positioned to fully deploy and leverage is 
data harvesting and data dissemination 
in a clear, concise, accessible app that 
easily provides only the single answer of 
the moment. The key to this is two-fold: 
gathering information from as many sources 
as possible then providing back in a clear, 
cohesive manner just the information a 
person or group requires merely for the task 
at hand. It is entirely possible to provide 
everything listed below via application 
developed that, today, would be accessed 
via smart device, positioning to then be 
integrated into vehicles equipped with Wifi 
and dash-mounted LCDS.
1. Way-finding from point A to B, for all 
transportation modes including: 
•	Pedestrian
•	Public transit
•	Bicycle
•	Personal vehicle
•	Corporate vehicle
•	Taxi, or sharing economy services
2. Environmental assessment
•	Effective routing
•	Time-based traffic congestion
•	Real-time alternate routing
•	Resources/paths to be more fully utilized
•	Planning for future corridors/
arteries
•	Carbon footprint
3. Again, the City infrastructure is 
positioned today to input the data 
required for an informed citizenry. The 
key will be the application, available 
today via smart device that can then be 
incorporated into a car with WiFi and 
dash LCD.
•	Parking availability
•	Trend
•	Real-time availability
•	City Events
•	Offer many opportunities to again 
incentivize citizen participation via 
downloading of the app.
•	Shows/Concerts
•	Games
•	Festivals
•	Dining
•	Transportation
•	Bus stop locations
•	Alternatives for persons of age or 
disability
•	Information and access to 
alternative transportation
•	Shared-ride/pool   
opportunities
•	Bicycles
4. The idea here is for a person, either 
urban area dwelling or arriving at Will 
Rogers World Airport or Greyhound 
Bus station, to immediately have 
access, via smart device app, access 
to any information required to make an 
informed decision about where to go, 
how to get there and what is available to 
do.
The key to success is twofold with support 
staffing being the major issue that needs to 26
Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Existing Standards, 
Architectures, and 
Certification Process
The key to this item is the information and 
metrics to be harvested. The City’s primary 
responsibility to assist architecture and 
standards developers will be to provide 
access to the vast amount information 
and metrics that are being gathered today 
that establishes a baseline and access 
to the information after installations are 
enhanced. In regard to ITS, the City has 
leaned on partner subject matter experts 
to assist in making sure existing standards, 
methodologies and architectures are 
followed when developing and implementing 
solutions. To the degree that the City is 
now looked to as “The Solution” regarding 
network connectivity and approaches as the 
model for ITS deployment of the future.be addressed. 
Staffing required to:
1. Engage vendors, pick-up and delivery, for 
participation
•	Develop the vendors presence for 
inclusion on the app
2. That accomplished, any citizen who has 
opted to download the app has  full 
access to any of the available services. 
“Incentivizing” participation. The key here is 
“How do WiFi providers accomplish “opting 
in” for participation today?” The City has 
extensively research, discussed and vetted 
the unlimited ways in which a citizen would 
have incentive to participate. Once the 
app is established and available, the value 
thereof will be easily and quickly grasped. 
Our biggest “salesman” will be word of 
mouth. However, vendor participation with 
discounts, access incentives to events in 
City owned facilities (Chesapeake, Cox, 
State Fair), the list goes on and on. The 
only limitation becomes how extensive the 
underpinning app needs to be.27
Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Goals & Objectives
The City of Oklahoma City is committed to 
providing measurable goals and objectives 
for its vision.  The City has had an internal 
data and performance management system 
called Leading for Results (LFR) for nearly 
ten years (http://data.okc.gov/applications/
lfrforcitizens/forms/LFRMetrics ), and is 
well prepared to add, collect, analyze, and 
learn from its Smart City measures. The 
actual measurable goals and objectives 
will be developed in an early step of 
preparing the Smart City Challenge Finalist’s 
application due in May 2016. 
These will be developed in conjunction with 
the City’s Finance Department and with 
the Metropolitan Planning Organization 
(MPO).  The MPO, the Association of 
Central Oklahoma Governments (ACOG), 
has already been asked to help create the 
set of targeted performance measures that 
relate to the primary impact of the proposed 
deployment and these will be generated 
and used. ACOG is currently upgrading 
some regional transportation performance 
measures and so is a great resource for 
defining Smart City Challenge measures. 
As a municipal government, Oklahoma City 
has been committed to looking strategically 
at all of our programs, the services they 
provide and the way they are provided. 
Oklahoma City uses the LFR performance 
management to link each department’s 
operations to a strategic business plan, 
and can create a system for the Smart City 
zone project. Each department’s strategic 
business plan is updated every other year 
and is organized into programs with each 
program having an approved budget and set 
of performance measures.In addition, independent evaluation will also 
be allowed and facilitated to allow validation 
of the system performance with respect 
to the targeted measures, to collect or 
infer needed contextual data, and to allow 
supplementary evaluation with respect to 
a broader set of measures of interest to 
the USDOT. The City of Oklahoma City 
will support the independent evaluator’s 
access to material and locations, and to the 
City’s staff to conduct evaluation-related 
experiments, interviews, and surveys.
Oklahoma City’s approach for monitoring 
the impact of the demonstration on mobility, 
safety, efficiency, sustainability, and climate 
change will become more elaborate 
during the Finalist’s application as well. In 
regard to transit and the self-driving car 
loops, for example, COTPA already has 
experience measuring for mobility (actual 
usage/ridership, geo-coded on-off data, 
vehicle on-time performance, customer 
complaints,  and so forth), and COTPA 
also measures and acts on safety data. In 
regard to efficiency, basic measures such as 
customers per mile, round-trip, and hour will 
be developed. Measures for sustainability 
and impacts on air pollution and climate 
change will be possible.28
Oklahoma City, OKOklahoma City’s 
Leveraging 
Opportunities
The City of Oklahoma City is in excellent 
financial health, as noted in its AAA bond 
rating from Standard & Poor’s and Aaa 
rating from Moody’s Investor Service, which 
were reaffirmed in January 2016. These 
ratings put Oklahoma City in an elite group 
of major American cities with the highest 
ratings possible.  Sound, conservative 
financial and debt management practices 
along with Oklahoma City’s role as a 
regional economic center contribute to the 
City consistently maintaining a high rating. 
There are opportunities to leverage Smart 
City and other Federal resources through 
cost sharing, in-kind staff assistance, and 
partnering. Private companies as well as 
the State DOT are likely to be Smart City 
Challenge partners who could offer some 
degree of leverage funds. Further, the City 
of Oklahoma City maintains a fund balance 
of at least 15% of its General Fund in 
operating reserves that can be used as local 
matching funds.26, 2016. The City Council unanimously 
approved the resolution authorizing the 
submittal of an application to the USDOT for 
a “Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” 
Grant.  The City has had an internal data 
and performance management system 
called Leading for Results (LFR) for nearly 
ten years, and is well prepared to add, 
collect, analyze, and learn from Smart City 
measures. Oklahoma City’s 
Capacity & 
Commitment
The City of Oklahoma City (OKC) has 
the capacity to take on a project of this 
magnitude as evidenced by its successful 
management of large local capital programs 
as well as federal grant administration.  In 
1993, Oklahoma City voters approved a 1 
cent sales tax initiative to fund $350 million 
in capital improvements.  Based on the 
initial success of the original Metropolitan 
Area ProjectS (MAPS) program, voters 
have approved two more extensions of that 
capital improvement program.  The MAPS 
for Kids initiative was approved by voters in 
2001 and invested $514 million of sales tax 
and $180 million in bond funds in the City’s 
school districts.   The MAPS3 program, 
approved by voters in 2009, is investing 
$777 million in capital improvement projects 
throughout our city. 
In addition to the MAPS program, Oklahoma 
City is successfully managing an $835 
million bond program to invest in local 
infrastructure.  In addition, Oklahoma City 
has a proven track record of state and 
federal grant management, whether it is 
our annual allocation of CDBG funding or 
through competitive grant programs like 
the $13.6 million TIGER grant that was 
awarded to the City in 2013. 
With its executive commitment, Smart City 
Challenge private sector partners and 
other stakeholders, it is clear that OKC 
has the capacity to manage the Smart 
City grant.  The executive commitment has 
been secured not only in the offices of 
both the Mayor and City Manager, but with 
several affected departments' directors. The 
executive commitment was also secured 
by the Oklahoma City Council on January 29
